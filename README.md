# funhouse

Initial data exploration and visualizations done in R
Modeling done in Python

### Data Exploration:

In order to better understand the variables `time`, `age`, `spider`, and `sound`, I first visualized them to view frequency of occurence and observe patterns:

It looks like the number of people who buy premium funhouse tickets and those who don't are nearly evenly matched.

The age of the customers and time of day that the tickets were sold seem to both be normally distributed.
